            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This roguelike multiplayer game is a passion project that combines classic roguelike mechanics with multiplayer gameplay. Players navigate procedurally generated dungeons, collect items, level up their characters, and develop unique skill builds to overcome increasingly difficult challenges.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The project demonstrates my ability to design complex game systems, implement networking for multiplayer functionality, and create engaging gameplay loops.</p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Multiplayer Synchronization:</strong> Implementing robust networking to ensure all players see consistent game state, especially with fast-paced combat and real-time item interactions.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Balancing Systems:</strong> Designing a leveling and item system that feels rewarding without becoming overpowered, requiring extensive playtesting and iteration.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Procedural Generation:</strong> Creating algorithms that generate interesting, playable levels while maintaining performance and ensuring fair difficulty curves.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>This project has been an invaluable learning experience in game development. I've gained deep expertise in GDScript and the Godot Engine, learned to implement complex multiplayer systems, and developed strong skills in game design and balancing.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Beyond the technical skills, I've learned the importance of iterative design, player feedback, and the art of creating compelling game loops that keep players engaged. Managing a long-term solo project has also taught me discipline, time management, and the persistence needed to bring ambitious ideas to life.</p>

            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <p>The game is still in active development with several planned features including:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li>Additional items and character customization options</li>
                <li>More enemy types and boss encounters</li>
                <li>Enhanced multiplayer features</li>
                <li>Newer animations for spells, and a higher level cap for spells</li>

            <h2>History of The Game</h2>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li>Was ported to an AWS cloud server, but got shut down as my free subscription expired</li>
                <li>I did develop a very crude version of the game in 3D</li>
                <li>The multiplayer version has been adapted from my single player 2D version</li>
                <li>The single player version is further along in development, but I will be adding everything, mainly items, from it to the multiplayer version</li>
